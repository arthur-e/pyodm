pyodm
=====

Backend-agnostic tools for loading and interacting with data in a CUAHSI ODM database

## Requirements:
+ Database connectors: For now I'm going to focus on maintaining compatibility for `pyodbc` 
for MS SQL Server and Access, `MySQLDB` for MySQL, and `psycopg2` for Postgres.
+ Pandas
+ Matplotlib
